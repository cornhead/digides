* Fault: cause of an error
* Error: erroneous state, but not directly observable in behaviour $\rightarrow$ might lead to failure, but not necessarily
* Failure: deviation from expected behaviour

# Coverage

Coverage criteria state when enough testing has been done.

## Control Flow Based Coverage Criteria

### Path Coverage

Execute every path the program could take at least once.

Easy counter example to see that path coverage has not been reached are loops: every new loop iteration constitutes a new path and all paths have to be taken. Path coverage is generally not always reachable, e.g., it es not achievable for the [following program](#inf_loop):

~~~ {#inf_loop .c .number-lines}
while (1) {
	if ( getchar () == EOF )
	break ;
}
~~~

### Statement Coverage

Execute every statement of the program (merely syntactic) at least once.

Statement Coverage is implied by path coverage. Hence, if statement coverage can't be achieved, path coverage can't be achieved either. On the other hand, if path coverage can't be achieved for a given program, statement coverage still can be reached, as is the case in [above program](#inf_loop).

If for a given program statement coverage can't be achieved, it is said to contain unreachable code:

~~~ {.c .number-lines}
if (false){
	...
}
~~~

### Branch Coverage

Execute every branch at least once.

In literature, the definitions of branches are rather imprecise $\rightarrow$ what about unconditional jumps, `goto`, function calls or fall-throughs?

### Condition Coverage

Exercise every boolean sub-expression/atom/condition outcome (but their values do not necessarily have to affect the overall outcome)

Condition coverage does not imply descision coverage, as can be seen by the following program, with the test cases $\{x=5, y=-3\}$ and $\{x=-1, y=2\}$

~~~ {.c .number-lines}
if ( ( x > 0) && ( y > 0) )
	x++;
~~~

All outcomes of the sub-expressions are exercised once but the decision never evaluated to `true`.

### Modified Condition / Decision Coverage (MC/DC)

Every condition in a decision has to have taken affect on the outcome at least once. (see the stuck-at error model in the lecture on digital design)

MC/DC is defined in DO-178B (high relevance in industry)

### Multiple Condition Coverage

For $n$ sub-conditions in a decision, try all $2^n$ combinations.







## Data Flow Based Coverage Criteria

* Definitions: assignment of a value to a variable
* Use: statement where the value of a variable is read
	* C(omputation)-Use: defines/computes other variables
	* P(redicate)-Use:  within conditional statements


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Name         Criteria
----------------------         -------------------------------------------------------------
              all-defs         all definitions get used at some point

            all-c-uses         one path from a definition to each c-use that is affected by that definition

            all-p-uses         one path from a definition to each p-use that is affected by that definition

all-c-uses/some-p-uses         same as all-c-uses, but if there are no c-uses, than at least one affected p-use needs to be triggered

all-p-uses/some-c-uses         same as all-p-uses, but if there are no c-uses, than at least one affected c-use needs to be triggered

              all-uses         all-c-uses and all-p-uses $\rightarrow$ all uses need to be executed

          all-du-paths         same as all-uses, but all possible du paths have to be taken at least once, not just one path
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mutation Testing





# Automated Test Case Generation

## Model based test case generation

General scheme:

#. develop an (abstract) model of the system.
#. automatically derive abstract test cases from the abstract model
#. map the abstract test cases to concrete ones
#. apply the concrete test cases to the implementation

![procedure for model based test case generation](./img/psv_tcg_1.png){width=75%}


Don't:

* extract test-cases from implementation
* apply test-cases extracted from model to generated code
* let coverage criteria drive your test-case generation



## Assertion Violations

Idea: try to find inputs that crash the system $\rightarrow$ no need to check output for correctness

Assertions can be used to express partial specifications:

* buffer overflow: `assert (i < len); ... a[i]`
* division by zero: `assert (y != 0); ... x/y`
* invalid pointer: `assert (p != NULL); ... *p`
* assertions for further specification

utilize SMT solvers to find such crashing inputs:

#. perform *symbolic* execution of a path $\rightarrow$ derive SMT formula representing current program state
#. at any assertion, ask an SMT solver for input values that lead to assertion failure

Naive exploration of paths quickly becomes a problem (search space explosion) $\rightarrow$ heuristics:

* breadt-first search
* depth-first search
* coverage-optimized (take that path that increases coverage the most)
* random selection

If we can check for assertion violations, we can check contracts.

## Oracle

Alternatively, we can ask an oracle for correct output.

The oracle could be:

* a less efficient (but correct) implementation
* an executable specification
* ...





# Model Checking

## Bounded Model Checking

We wish, we could automate Haore reasoning, but finding loop invariants can't be generated automatically. Work-around: we restrict ourselves to a finite amount of loop iteration $\rightarrow$ bounded model checking

"Forwards with Hoare": calculate stronges post-condition to a given pre-condition and a statement $sp(stmt, P)$

--------------------------------------------------------------
            `stmt`   $sp(stmt, P)$
------------------   ----------------------------------------
         `x := e;`   $\exists x': x=e[x/x'] \wedge P[x/x']$
   
       `assert R;`   $P \wedge R$
 
   `stmt1; stmt2;`   $sp(stmt_2, sp(stmt_1, P))$
 
 `ite(B, C1, C2);`   $sp(C_1, B \wedge P) \vee sp(C_2, \neg B \wedge P)$
----------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Rules for "Forwards with Hoare" (stronges post-condition)

The last rule in the table is interesting: it merges two paths $\rightarrow$ useful to avoid exponential blow up through loop unwinding.

**Loop unwinding**: Unwindig a loop for a given amount of iterations. In last iteration, insert so called unwinding assertion, which lets us know if more iterations were possible.

The program fragment ```while(B){ BODY }```{.c} can be unwound to the following program:

~~~ {.c .number-lines}
if (B){
	BODY
	if (B){
		BODY
		.
		 .
		  .
			if (B){
				assert false; // unwinding assertion
			}
		  .
		 .
		.
	}
}
~~~

Table: Syntax and semantics for path quantifiers

## Subsets of CTL*

**CTL**: Like CTL* but every temporal operator has to be preceded immediately by a path quantifier

**LTL**: The formula has to start with the **A**-operator but apart from that, no path quantifiers are allowed. (Usually the preceding **A** can be omitted)

There are CTL formulas that can't be expresed in LTL and vice versa

CTL has 10 basic operators -- 5 temporal operators times 2 path quantifiers -- but all of them can be expressed through **EX**, **EG** and **EU**

## Satisfiability

### Example 1, taken from the exam in June 2016
Check the satisfiability of the following SMT formulas. Assume that $x,y,z,a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$ are integer constants, and $f:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ and $g:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ are binary and unary uninterpreted functions over integers respectively. Whenever a formula is satisfiable, give a satisfyingassignment for it, i.e., integer values for all variables and function interpretations overintegers that make the formula true under the assignment.  Whenever a formula is notsatisfiable, give a reason why it is unsatisfiable.

## Temporal Logic

### Example 1, taken from the exam in June 2016

Consider the following Kripke Structure:

![Kripke-structure](./img/psv_exam_2016_5.png){width=60%}

For each formula,  give the states of the Kripke structure for which the formula holds. In other words, consider the computation trees starting with one of the states from the set $\{s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3\}$, and for each tree, check whether the given formula holds on it or not.

---------------------------
           formula     states in which it holds
------------------     ------------------------
    $b \wedge AXa$     $\{s_0\}$

      $a \vee AXb$     $\{s_1, s_2, s_3\}$

$AFAGa \vee AFAGb$     $\{s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3\}$

      $EFG \neg b$     $\{s_0, s_1, s_2\}$

             $AGa$     $\{s_1\}$

### Example 3, taken from the exam in June 2019

#### A)

Consider the following Kripke Structure:

![Kripke-structure](./img/psv_exam_2019_4_1.png){width=60%}

For each formula, give the states of the Kripke structure for which the formula holds. In other words, for each of the states from the set $\{s_0, s_1, s_2\}$, consider the computation trees starting at that state, and for each tree, check whether the given formula holds on it or not.

---------------------------
           formula     states in which it holds
------------------     ------------------------
          $A(FGa)$     $\{s_0, s_1, s_2\}$

           $AFAGa$     $\{s_1, s_2\}$ (is $s_0$ correct?)

  $A(a \wedge Xa)$     $\{s_2\}$

          $E(bUa)$     $\{s_0, s_1, s_2\}$
---------------------------

#### B)

Consider the following Kripke Structure with initial state $s_0$ :

![Kripke-structure](./img/psv_exam_2019_4_2.png){width=60%}

Does the LTL formula $AFXb$ hold in the initial state $s_0$ ?

$\rightarrow$ *yes, because all paths have to pass $s_2$ or $s_4$ eventually. Before they do so, $Xb$ will hold*

Does the CTL formula $AFAXb$ hold in the initial state $s_0$ ?

$\rightarrow$ *no, because the path that loops around $s_0 \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow s_0 \rightarrow$... does not satisfy it.*
